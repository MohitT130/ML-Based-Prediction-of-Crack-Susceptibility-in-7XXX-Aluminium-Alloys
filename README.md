# ML-Based-Prediction-of-Crack-Susceptibility-in-7XXX-Aluminium-Alloys
Built an ML model to predict crack susceptibility (high, very high, low, very low, medium) based on alloy composition. Trained on 600+ datapoints with 16 alloying elements, extracted from research papers. Applied feature engineering and data-driven metallurgy to enhance prediction accuracy
